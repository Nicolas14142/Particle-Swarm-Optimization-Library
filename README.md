# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Library
Provides a dynamic library that contains a implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm 

You have to use the ParticleSwarmOptimization1 function and create 4 arrays in your closed loop application to storage the positions, PSO positions, velocities and the last best positions of your particles. 
The PSO positions will be carrier the information of the next points that your particles have to go.
